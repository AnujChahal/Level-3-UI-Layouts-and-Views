# Level-3-UI-Layouts-and-Views

This project demonstrates **UI Layouts and Views in Android** using **Jetpack Compose** and traditional XML-based layouts.  
The highlight of this level is building a **BMI Calculator App** with dynamic results, showcasing how different layouts and views can be combined effectively.

## 📌 Level 3: UI Layouts & Views

### Jetpack Compose Basics
- Introduction to declarative UI programming.
- Composables for building reusable UI components.
- State management with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`.

### Layout Types
- **Linear Layout**: Arranges elements vertically or horizontally.
- **Constraint Layout**: Flexible positioning with constraints.
- **Frame Layout**: Stacks elements on top of each other.
- **Relative Layout**: Positions elements relative to each other.

### Common Views
- **Buttons**: Trigger actions on user interaction.
- **TextView**: Display text content.
- **ImageView**: Show images and icons.
- **ScrollView**: Enable scrolling for long content.

## 📱 App: BMI Calculator
- Input: Height and Weight.
- Output: Dynamic BMI result with category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
- UI: Combines layouts and views to create a clean, interactive interface.
- Demonstrates handling user input, calculations, and updating UI dynamically.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Beginners often struggle with:
- Understanding different Android layouts and their use cases.
- Managing multiple views in a single screen.
- Handling user input and updating UI dynamically.
- Building a functional app that integrates layouts and logic.

---

## 🛠️ Solution Workflow
1. **Setup Project** in Android Studio with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
2. **Design Layouts** using Linear, Constraint, Frame, and Relative layouts.
3. **Add Views** (Buttons, TextView, ImageView, ScrollView).
4. **Implement BMI Logic** to calculate results based on user input.
5. **Connect UI & Logic** to update results dynamically.
6. **Test App** on emulator and real device.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin  
- **UI Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose & XML Layouts  
- **IDE**: Android Studio  
- **Build System**: Gradle (KTS DSL)  
- **Testing**: Emulator & Physical Device  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **UI Layer**: Composables and XML layouts for different views.  
- **Activity Layer**: `MainActivity` hosting the BMI Calculator UI.  
- **Logic Layer**: BMI calculation based on height and weight.  
- **State Management**: `remember` for dynamic updates.  
- **Resources**: Organized under `res` (strings, drawables, layouts).

## 📖 Relevance and Learning
By completing this project, learners will:
- Understand the basics of Jetpack Compose and XML layouts.  
- Learn how to use Linear, Constraint, Frame, and Relative layouts effectively.  
- Gain hands-on experience with common views like Buttons, TextView, ImageView, and ScrollView.  
- Build a functional app (BMI Calculator) that integrates UI and logic.  
- Develop confidence in designing interactive Android applications.  

This level builds the **foundation for advanced UI/UX design** and prepares learners for more complex app development.
